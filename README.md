How To Install
--------------

This package uses the [scoped registry] feature to resolve package
dependencies. Please add the following sections to the manifest file
(Packages/manifest.json).

To the `scopedRegistries` section:

```
{
  "name": "Keijiro",
  "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
  "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
}
```

To the `dependencies` section:

      "url": "https://registry.npmjs.com",
      "scopes": [ "jp.keijiro" ]
